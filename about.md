### Philip Park -- A Short Summary

Hi, I'm Philip Park! I'm a double major student at NYU studying Computer Science and Game Design. I've lived in New York my whole life (so unfortunately, yes, that means I'm one of those icky commuter students), but being that this is my last semester in NYU perhaps that will change soon! 

In my free time, you'll probably find me playing obscure Nintendo games or dancing (here's a dance video I made in the Fall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfoC1ogfPCM). I will be looking forward to this class!
